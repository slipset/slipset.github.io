My twitter feed is full. Over a couple of years, I've curated a bunch
of people to follow. Some tweet often, some not. Some retweet links to
relevant articles, some write the articles. Some are just funny,
others are very serious.

And I have this fear of missing the one really important/cool/funny
tweet, so I spend a lot of time skimming through all these tweets.

So what I'd be willing to subscribe to and pay for is a service which
every morning, in my timezone, presented me with a list of the top
interesting articles from my feed. This would be a happy mix of
articles from my local newspapers, the most recent blogposts from the
people I enjoy reading, perhaps a couple of posts from people I didn't
know I'd enjoy reading.

But I'd also need the one or two tweets everyday which I find funny or
intriguing.

I guess I need a personal tweeter.

Anyone?
