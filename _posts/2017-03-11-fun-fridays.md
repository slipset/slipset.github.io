At work we have this concept of "Fun Fridays" - every other Friday we get to work on whatever we want. 
It's a plus if it's work related, but that's not required. This is nothing new, Google has had it for years.

So, what do you do on a Fun Friday? Very often it seems like stuff that's in category of 
"stuff I want to do with our product/project that never gets prioritized" or maybe "I really wonder if this works?".

But I've been wanting to do something else for quite a while. I'm a [mender](http://corgibytes.com/blog/makers/menders/software/2015/08/14/makers-vs-menders/),
so greenfield work is not so attractive to me. I need some scaffolding to be present for me to work, and I really like hunting bugs and
rewriting old code. So how can I relate this to our Fun Fridays?

Well, I can contribute to OSS. 

And that's just what happened yesterday. 

Earlier this week [@bbatsov](htttps://twitter.com/bbatsov), the master brewer of [CIDER](https://cider.readthedocs.org) tweeted:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want to get involved in CIDER&#39;s development a good place to start would be a &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; issue <a href="https://t.co/sa1ONLGZyh">https://t.co/sa1ONLGZyh</a></p>&mdash; Bozhidar Batsov (@bbatsov) <a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/585880821531340800">April 8, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
which resulted in this [PR](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1957)

So here's the deal:

If you're maintaining an OSS related to Clojure, and want a part of my 10% time, I'd be more than happy working on the most mundane tasks.
I don't expect much, but for me to finish something within the day, I do need issues that are "ready for work". Like the issue above,
fixing doc-errors for CIDER is pretty straight forward and was very easy to start working on.

I'm aware that making issues "ready for work" for someone unfamiliar with the project is a lot of work, in fact almost as much as 
fixing the issue yourself, but consider it an investment for the future.
