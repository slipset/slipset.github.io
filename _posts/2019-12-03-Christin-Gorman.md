This morning, a tweet came across my time line:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

and watching the talk I was reminded of what a great speaker Christin is, in my opinion she's clearly one of Norways best.

But as you'll see from the talk, she is not only a great speaker, she also has strong opinions, many of which she expresses
in her blog over [here](https://qristin.wordpress.com) (mainly in Norwegian).

So as I was watching the video I linked to over, I was thinking, maybe todays Advent of Parens post should be a post
saying that I basically think she is really damn impressive!

And then, when I come home, I see this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Current status:
<br>
Being told my opinions don&#39;t matter because I&#39;m irrational and don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about,
I need to read the documentation, blablabla.<br>How&#39;s your day going?

Which simply makes me want to say, hang in there Christin! You are the one who knows what you're talking about!

And for the rest of you, if you're ever in need of a speaker at your conference, or a strong voice in your panel, 
you know who to contact.
